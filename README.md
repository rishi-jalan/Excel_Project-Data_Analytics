### Introduction

This data jobs salary dashboard was created to help job seekers investigate salaries for their desired jobs and ensure they are being adequately compensated. 

The data is from my Excel course, which provides a foundation in analyzing data using this powerful tool. The data contains detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills that are presented here.

### Dashboard File
My final dashboard is in [1_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx](1_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx).

## Project 2 Analysis

### Introduction

As a former job seeker, I’ve always been surprised by the lack of data exploring the most optimal jobs and skills in the data science market. I set out to understand what skills top employers request and how to land more pay.

### Questions to Analyze

To understand the data science job market, I asked the following:

1. **Do more skills get you better pay?**
2. **What’s the salary for data jobs in different regions?**
3. **What are the top skills of data professionals?**
4. **What’s the pay for the top 10 skills?**
